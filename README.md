# HAPPINES INDEX OF VITAP STUDENTS- A SURVEY

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing student feedback data using Python. The analysis includes visualizations such as radar charts, bar graphs, line graphs, stacked bar plots, tables, violin plots, box plots, scatter plots, and bar plots to provide insights into various aspects of the feedback.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading

The provided Python script loads CSV data as a string and converts it into a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv` function.

### 2. Radar Chart

A radar chart is created to visually represent feedback across different categories for each student. The chart provides a comprehensive view of individual student satisfaction levels.

### 3. Total Bar Graph

A bar graph is generated to display the total scores for each feedback category. This allows for a quick comparison of the overall performance in different aspects.

### 4. Total Line Graph

A line graph is used to show the total scores across all categories for each student. This visualization helps track overall satisfaction trends for individual students.

### 5. Stacked Bar Plot

A stacked bar plot illustrates the percentage contribution of each category to the total score for each student. This provides insights into the relative importance of different feedback aspects.

### 6. Table for Total Scores

A table is created to present the total scores for each student across all categories. This tabular representation offers a detailed breakdown of individual student feedback.

### 7. Violin Plot

A violin plot is generated to depict the distribution of total scores across all students. This visualization helps understand the spread and concentration of feedback scores.

### 8. Box Plot

A box plot is used to display the distribution of total scores, providing insights into the central tendency and variability of the feedback data.

### 9. Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is created to visualize the total scores across all students. This plot helps identify any patterns or outliers in the feedback data.

### 10. Bar Plot for Total Scores Distribution

A bar plot illustrates the distribution of total scores across all students. This visualization gives an overview of how scores are distributed among different ranges.

## Conclusion

The combination of these visualizations provides a comprehensive analysis of student feedback, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
